/* responsive centered text snippet */

/* how does this work:
simple case of flexbox-based container centering, along with a max-width on the content and a margin on the body, both of which work to ensure a cleanly
responsive box that works on screens large and small. The text never gets annoyingly wide and hard to read on wide viewports; on small/vertical screens, it shrinks to fit, while maintaining some spacing between content and edges */

body {
    /* the margin serves to maintain a minimum of "padding" even on very small screens, so content isn't right up against edges */
    margin: 2rem 3rem;
    /*     border: 1px solid coral; */
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    /*     align-items: flex-end; */
    /*     flex-flow: column nowrap; */
    /*     background-color: papayawhip; */

}

section {
    /*     display: flex;
    flex: 0 auto;
    flex-flow: column nowrap; */

    max-width: 40rem;
